# Millennials Spending Analysis
In this repository I make some analysis on the spending behaviour of the millennials and I try to predict how they will spend their money in the future.

## Data

I use data coming from a survey of the US Bureau of Labour Statistics. The data is available [here](http://www.bls.gov/cex/csxcross.htm#y1213).
